abstract = {The Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) concept is a rapidly evolving Generation IV design that has recently attracted favorable attention due to the potential for reducing waste generation, realizing passive safety features, and seizing on the opportunity for cost effective economics. An investigation into the power transient behavior of an autonomous load-following, closed-loop, natural circulation MSR system is important to quantifying operational and safety performance under dynamic conditions. This paper presents the results of a STAR-CCM+ and a comparatively simple asymmetric, one-dimensional, numerical model to solve the compound dynamic MSR power behavior subject to flow and temperature reactivity feedback only. Results show that reactor power is affected by fuel salt flow velocity (global) and temperatures (local bulk volume averages) in a coupled, time-delayed manner that results in a unique compound dynamic, closed-loop power feedback mechanism. The 1-D simulation approach opens the possibility of performing inexpensive computations to evaluate time-dependent reactor performance relative to thermo-physical fuel salt limitations. Results also potentially motivate a convincing conclusion that natural circulation MSRs provide a leap in safety and reliability.}

abstract = {The TENDL library is now established as one of the major nuclear data libraries in the world, striving for completeness and quality of nuclear data files for all isotopes, evaluation methods, processing and applied performance. To reach this status, some basic principles have been applied which sets it apart from other libraries: reproducible dedicated evaluations when differential data are available, through determination of nuclear models implemented in TALYS and their parameters, completeness (with or without experimental data), format and processing standardization, automation of production and reproducibility. In this paper, we will outline how such an approach has become a reality, and recall some of the past successes since the first TENDL release in 2008. Next, we will demonstrate the performance of the latest TENDL releases for different application fields, as well as new approaches for uncertainty quantification based on Bayesian inference methods and possible differential and integral adjustments. Also, current limitations of the library performances due to modelling and needs for new and more precise experimental data will be outlined.}
